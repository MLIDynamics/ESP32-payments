While signing the transaction, there is a function called "compile_output" in transaction.c (trezor-mcu) that generates the change address to be included in the output of a transaction. However, it generates using "hdnode_private_ckd". While we wont use the private key for any immediate signing, can I safely use "hdnode_public_ckd" function to generate the public key and hash it to get the change Address?
